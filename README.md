# SportsScheduler
A terminal based sports scheduler generator using a round robin algorithm. Built using pure Python.

I created an auto league generator for sports teams. The program includes the following features:

  - Add or change your league name
  - Add teams to your league manually
  - Delete teams from your league manually
  - Display the current teams in your league
  - Assign teams to divisions. (Division options: 0, 2, or 4 divisions)
  - Choose between manual or random division assignment
  - Team templates are provided for quick use of how the program works
  - If the league has less than 16 teams, only 0 or 2 divisions are allowed for the league.
  - Choose how many weeks will be in your league
  - A Round Robin algorithm calculates and prints out the full schedule
  
I have implemented lots of error checking to ensure the program doesn't quit if user input disrupts work flow of the program.
